###  AWSAutomation
     Anytime we engage with a new client or create a new AWS account; we have to go through the same 
     mundane tasks of creating infrastruture, network, security and other tasks which can and 
     should be automated. 
     This is an attemp to take pain out of those mundane AWS tasks like initializing VPC, SG, 
     ELB, Route53, RDS etc. 
     
     The Definition of Done (DoD) for this project is when using command line or file variables, 
     anyone should be able to create most secure and efficient AWS infrastructure.
